# Docker Production Setup Guide

## Current Status

The Docker production setup has been configured but is experiencing encryption-related issues. Here's what has been fixed and what needs to be done:

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- Docker Compose syntax updated
- Environment variables configured
- ActiveRecord encryption disabled
- SSL disabled in production
- Master key requirement disabled
- All unnecessary files cleaned up

### ❌ Remaining Issue
- Rails application fails to start due to encryption errors

## Quick Start

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   ./start_production.sh
   ```

2. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f web
   ```

3. **Stop the application:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   ```

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains:
- Database configuration
- Rails master key and secret key base
- Razorpay configuration (temporary keys)
- SMTP configuration (temporary settings)

## Next Steps

1. **Replace Razorpay keys** with your actual keys in `.env`
2. **Update SMTP settings** for email functionality
3. **Investigate encryption issue** - this may require:
   - Checking for encrypted data in the database
   - Reviewing Rails cache files
   - Examining any encrypted configuration files

## Troubleshooting

If the application still doesn't start:

1. Check the logs: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f web`
2. Try running in development mode locally to isolate the issue
3. Consider creating a fresh Rails application and migrating the code
