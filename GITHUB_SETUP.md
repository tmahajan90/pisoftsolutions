# ðŸš€ Push Project to GitHub

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Login to your account**
3. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
4. **Select "New repository"**
5. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Repository name**: `pisoftsolutions` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Pisoft Solutions - Rails e-commerce app with Razorpay integration`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Choose a license" (optional)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pisoftsolutions.git

# Set the main branch as upstream
git branch -M main

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify the Push

1. **Go to your GitHub repository page**
2. **You should see all your files there**
3. **Check that sensitive files are NOT included**:
   - `.env` file should NOT be visible
   - `config/master.key` should NOT be visible
   - `config/credentials.yml.enc` should be visible (this is encrypted)

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables (Important!)

Since your `.env` file is not pushed to GitHub, you need to set up environment variables for deployment:

### For Development (Local)
- Your `.env` file is already set up locally
- No additional action needed

### For Production (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
Set these environment variables in your hosting platform:
```bash
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_actual_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_actual_razorpay_key_secret
```

## Step 5: Update README.md (Optional)

You might want to update the README.md file with:
- Project description
- Setup instructions
- Features list
- Screenshots

## Security Checklist âœ…

- [ ] `.env` file is NOT in the repository
- [ ] `config/master.key` is NOT in the repository
- [ ] Razorpay API keys are NOT exposed
- [ ] Database credentials are NOT exposed
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files

## Files That Should NOT Be in GitHub

- `.env` (contains API keys)
- `.env.backup*` (backup files)
- `config/master.key` (Rails master key)
- `log/*.log` (log files)
- `tmp/*` (temporary files)
- `storage/*` (uploaded files)

## Files That SHOULD Be in GitHub

- `env_example.txt` (template for environment variables)
- `config/credentials.yml.enc` (encrypted credentials)
- All source code files
- Configuration files
- Documentation files

## Next Steps After Pushing

1. **Set up deployment** (Heroku, Railway, Render, etc.)
2. **Configure environment variables** in your hosting platform
3. **Set up database** in production
4. **Test the application** in production environment

## Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" Error
- Check if the repository URL is correct
- Make sure you have access to the repository
- Verify your GitHub credentials

### "Permission denied" Error
- Check your GitHub authentication
- Use SSH keys or personal access tokens if needed

### Missing Files in Repository
- Check `.gitignore` file
- Make sure files are not accidentally ignored
- Use `git status` to see what's tracked

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check remote repository
git remote -v

# Check status
git status

# Check what files are tracked
git ls-files

# Check what files are ignored
git status --ignored

# Push changes
git push origin main

# Pull changes
git pull origin main
```
